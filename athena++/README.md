The overall athena++ public branch used in this code is archived on zenodo at:
https://zenodo.org/record/6325874#.ZGd2fuzMJBw

This is mostly similar to the public athena++ 21 release, with several additional code hooks added, and an algorithm to average zones near the poles of the spherical polar coordinates (see src/hydro/average_conserved.cpp)

The problem generator file should be placed in src/pgen/
